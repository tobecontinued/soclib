# As soclib-simulate-any includes all devices, it includes deprecated as well.
# As it is the first compiled example by newcomers, I try not to scare them too much.
# So I disable warnings about deprecation of modules needed by soclib-simulate-any.
#
# DONT COPY THESE LINES ANYWHERE ELSE
# I'LL REMOVE THEM FROM REPOSITORY IF I SEE THEM IN ANOTHER PLATFORM
